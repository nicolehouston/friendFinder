# friendFinder

This is a node express app that matches you with compatible friends based on survey results.

## Instructions

* Complete the survey.
* The app then compares the difference between your scores against those from other users, question by question. 
* The differences are added up to calculate the `totalDifference`.
     * Example: 
       * User 1: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * User 2: `[3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * Total Difference: **2 + 1 + 2 =** **_5_**
* The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.
